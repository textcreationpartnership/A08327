            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

againſt them, and take hold of ſome one which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth a little ſhew and ſemblance of countenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their fancyes. For example, they once read in S. Matthew, <hi>The Lord thy God ſhalt thou adore, and</hi>

            <p>Againe they looke into few thinges not only in adhering, but chiefly in expounding ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer paſſages as they firſt light vpon: for neglecting the publique ſpirit &amp; voyce of God which ſpeaketh in his Church, neglecting the generall tribunall and conſiſtory of the world, they hearken only to the outward letter, and to the priuate ſpirit which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth in themſelues, by them only they interprete and by them only they willbe tryed whether their interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be good or no. As if a theefe accuſed of felony would deliuer his owne tale as he frameth it, <note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are fitly compared to the guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who admitteth no triall but his owne.</note> and admit no examination of witneſſes, no tryall of iury, or ſentence of iudge, no former preſidents or deciſions of like caſe, but his owne information &amp; voyce of his Soueraigne diuulged in his law, which he maketh to ſound as himſelfe liketh beſt; were not this to ſtop his eares againſt all teſtimonies but his owne, to refuſe all triall or iudgment which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being guilty doth not pronounce, and yet ſuch is our aduerſaryes dealing.

then by the publique word of God interpreted by themſelues.

            <p>They looke into few things when challenging at leaſt in outward ſhew one or two, they deſpiſe all other Sacraments of God &amp; ancient ceremonyes of the Church. When pleading for fayth alone, they gayne ſay the valew of workes, and ſupernaturall dignity of infinite vertues. When ſcandalized at the licentiouſnes of ſome diſſolute liuers in the Catholik Church, they admire not the heriocall acts and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plendent ſanctity of ſo many zealous Prelates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Prieſtes, Religious Friers, Monkes, Nunnes, and whole armies of Saints, which flouriſh therein. When diſmayed with the faygned impoſſibility of keeping Gods Commandements, they lift not vp their eyes to his Euangelicall Counſels and workes of ſupererogation. When dazeled with the Sunne of Chriſts glorious morits, they ſee not the beames

Of which opinion the Pelagians alſo were, who required hereunto the full complement, &amp; abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all kind of ſuch vertues, vnto which by their labour &amp; induſtry they preſumed to atteyne. Secondly, the Donatiſtes craued not ſo much; they indeed exacted grace &amp; iuſtice, receauing only the good and iuſt into the fold of Chriſt, and excluding all grieuous ſinners; yet not the weake and imperfect as the former did. Thirdly, <hi>VVickliffe</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> deſired neither complete ſanctity nor any dram of inward grace, but the outward election and predeſtination of God, auouching all the predeſtinate, &amp; none els to appertaine to the true Church which is the body of Chriſt. Of this triple generation of prodigious broodes <hi>VVhitaker,</hi> with whome <hi>Fulke</hi> ſeemeth to agree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettethone hideous monſter formed &amp; compoſed of them all together, ſaying: The Catholique Church conſiſteth not of <hi>any wicked and reprobate, but only of the elect, iuſt, holy, &amp; predeſtinate.</hi> Yet if you beleeue his wordes, he differeth from the firſt opinion, becauſe he taketh <hi>neither iust men as the Nouitians, nor perfect as the Pelagians,</hi> for ſuch as haue not their faultes &amp; imperfections; he diſſenteth from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe <hi>he excludeth none once iustified by true beliefe, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ all into neuer ſo deteſtable crimes:</hi> He varieth from the third, becauſe <hi>he requireth internall faith in the predeſtinate, before they can be admitted into the lappe of the Church.</hi> And then he cunnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly complyeth with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all againe, affirming no faultes, or imperfections to be imputed to the holy &amp; regenerate,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23864:12"/>
nor any grieuous crimes, to be hurtefull to the iuſt, or make them looſe their iuſtice, all the faith full to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and iuſt, and none truly faithfull, but only the electe.

               <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument I produce in proofe heerof, is <note place="margin">The firſt argument for the Churches infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> gethered from the aſſiſtance of Chriſt, &amp; direction of the holy ghoſt who ſo ſweetely moue, guide, and inſpire the hartes of the faythfull, as they cannot be entangled, or ſeduced with errour. Our Sauiour promiſed his aſſiſtance ſaying: <hi>Behold, I am with you all dayes, euen to the conſumation of the world.</hi> With you baptizing, &amp; <hi>teaching Nations to obſerue</hi>

                  <hi>all thinges whatſoeuer I haue commaunded.</hi> He promiſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, &amp; direction of the holy ghoſt: <hi>I will aske the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; he wilt giue you another paraclet, that he may abide with you for euer, the ſpirit of truth.</hi> And, <hi>when he the ſpirit of truth cometh, he shall teach you all truth.</hi> If all truth, &amp; that for euer, then no errour at any tyne, in any article of neuer ſo ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Secondly, <hi>S. Paul</hi> witneſſeth: <hi>God gaue ſome Apoſtles, &amp; ſome prophets &amp; other ſome Euangeliſtes, &amp; other ſome paſtours, &amp;</hi>

But as we can be led into no offenſe, ſmal, nor grieuous, materiall nor formal, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable nor inculpable, into nothing diſſonant or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto truth, by imbracing the direction, or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in their own affertions holding the true Church may erre, and yet themſelus certain of truth.</note> the commandment of truth it ſelf: ſo we can tumble into no errour little or great, curable or incurrable, by following the direction or ſafe conduct of the Church.

Our Lord hath prepared his holy army in the ſight of all the Gentills: and all the endes of the earth shall ſee the ſaluation of our God.</hi> From theſe and the like ſentences Saint Auguſtine gathereth that the Church is not here or there, or in the deſert, <hi>where there is not a frequent multitude:</hi> but (quoth he) <hi>you haue the Church to be euery where diffuſed, and to increaſe vntill harueſt: you haue the Citty of which he that built it, ſayd: A Citty cannot be hid placed vpon a mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Saint Pacian expreſly tearmeth, the <hi>Catholike Church a full and ſolide body ſpread ouer all the world:</hi> and not like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentieles of heretikes whome he calleth, <hi>an inſolent portion, or ſwelling bunche ſeparated from the reſt of the body.</hi> Saint Auguſtine (for Optatus and Saint Ieromes wordes I haue cited elſ where) compareth, <hi>the Church to a fruitfull vine, ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her braunches farre and neere throughout all nations,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes <hi>to broken boughes cut from the vine:</hi> he often auerreth that the <hi>whole world is Chriſtes poſſeſſion, all the borders of the earth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi> His <hi>Church a great mountayne which replenisheth the whole face of the earth.</hi> And thereby he inferreth that the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſtes

               <p n="2">2. Wherefore if by this marke you ſeeke to finde out the true Church of Chriſt, amongſt ſo many which falſly beare his name, caſt abroad your eyes into al forrayn coaſts and countryes, in euery place ſhall you find our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, that is, ſuch as be of the ſame beliefe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the world and agreing in the ſame beliefe.</note> with vs, in all points of fayth, acknowledging one and the ſame heade the Pope of Rome. This Church now raygneth in Europe, Afrike, Aſia, in Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Syria, Capadocia, Phrigia, Meſopotamia, in a great part of America, Megallanica, India, Iaponia, Braſilia, China; yea in all the flouriſhing ſtates, &amp; knowne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth. Whereas the Proteſtants are locked vp in very narrow ſtraites, in reſpect of vs, they are reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the mountanies of Germany, Ilandes of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, borders of Denmarke, within ſome Prouinces of the low Countryes and Cantons of France.

               <p>12. Let me poſe you M. Whitaker: Doth he not deſerue as great a curſe, who ſhall now deny the Paſſion and Reſurrection of Chriſt, as any heretike ſhould doe, in gaynſaying it in Saint Auguſtines tymes? And yet S. Auguſtine maketh a like compariſon, between thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes <note place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23864:91"/>
are generally verifyed of all times and ages.</p>
               <p>13. But Doctour Whitaker obiecteth that there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>VVhitak. cont.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> was a tyme at the beginning when the Church was not vniuerſal. I anſwere that as there is a tyme, when a child new borne cannot actually laugh, or exerciſe the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, yet is then a true man, and hath the power or faculty of laughing: So the Church in her infancy, was not actually dilated, and propagated ouer all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes: yet it was then planted to be vniuerſall, and had the property of vniuerſality belonging to it. Becauſe Chriſt at the firſt erecting of it ſayd: <hi>Teach ye all nations. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

Howbeit Mayſter Whitaker ceaſeth not to wrangle. For becauſe he cannot challenge the right of the thinge, he picketh a quarrell at the etimology of the name Catholike: he will not haue it to ſignify vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of place, but only of the truth, ſaying: <hi>That Church, is</hi>

               <p>14. But how can it thus be a note of the true Church? The true doctrine in all dogmaticall poyntes as I haue heretofore declared, is more obſcure and hidden then the Church. It is the inward ſubſtance or dowry of the Church. It cannot poſſibly be diſcerned eſpecially by the vnlearned, nor conſequently guide them to the knowledge of the Church. It is conſtantly challenged by all heretikes whatſoeuer. Aske the Arian, the Pelagian, the Gnoſticke, the Anabaptiſt &amp;c. Euery one of them &amp;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:23864:92"/>
whoſoeuer elſe, will tell you that he alone hath the vniuerſall truth: and it would be a bootleſſe labour, to goe about by that marke taken in that ſenſe, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him the contrary: Yet into this labyrinth other heretikes of former tymes haue craftily retired.

Gregory, as moſt Proteſtants accord, was the laſt good and firſt Antichriſtian Pope, then in his dayes ſome monſtrous innouation was brought not only into the Roman dioceſſes, but into al the Prouinces and Churches of Chriſtendome, which communicated with him, as appeareth out of his Epiſtles to the Biſhops of all countryes, of Sicily, Corſira, Sardinia, Africa, Numidia, Hiſpania, Gallia, Anglia, Hibernia, Grecia, Dalmatia, ouer whome he exerciſed the ſoueraygnty of his ſupreme iuriſdiction: yet he innouated nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor deliuered any other new doctrine not taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I demonſtrate. 1.

Is it the orthodoxall &amp; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fayth?
